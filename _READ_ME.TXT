Hello!

This package is the complete project for the NES version of Magician, released by Taxan Kaga in 1991.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magician_(video_game)

"Magician is a side-scrolling role-playing game released in February 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was designed by Eurocom Entertainment Software and published by Taxan."

I am releasing this package to the community for educational purposes only.  You are free to play with it and do with it as you will, but you are NOT allowed to make money out of it or profit in any way, shape or form.  I know you won't.  I trust you.

This was the Eurocom's first game, and was the game we used to pitch to Taxan and get our first gig.  I designed the game, and programmed our tools and game editors.  I also started programming John Smith (Special Agent), later released as James Bond Jr., on NES, while Magician was under development.  If you ever meet me and buy me a beer, I'll tell you some stories.  I hope you enjoy messing with this code as much as I did creating it.

Cheers!
