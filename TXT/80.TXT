00 "you are standing at the base of a tall tower. you try to see the top but it is lost in darkness."
01 "the razor-edged spikes pull you towards them!"
02 "the weight of your iron boots brings you back to earth."
03 "an effervescent fountain brightens the room."
04 "the far wall contains five niches. four are empty but the fifth holds an empty potion vial."
05 "the vial is held firmly in place by an invisible force."
06 "as soon as you attempt to use the vial it vanishes but reappears in one of the empty niches."
07 "as the last vial takes it's place, the four elements combine to form the legendary and powerful ultimate potion!"
08 "the force that held the vial is gone. you take the ultimate potion."
